<h6> Auli'i Cravalho - How far I'll Go </h6>

<p> I've been staring at the edge of the water, <br>
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why. <br> 
I wish I could be the perfect daughter, <br>
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try. <br>
Every turn I take, every trail I track, <br>
Every path I make, every road leads back, <br>
To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be. <br>

<p> See the lines where the sky meets the sea? It calls me <br> 
And no one knows, how far it goes <br>
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me <br>
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go <br>

<P> I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island <br>
everything is by design, <br>
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island, <br>
So maybe I can roll with mine. <br>
</p>

<p> I can lead with pride, I can make us strong, <Br>
I'll be satisfied if I play along, <Br>
But the voice inside sings a different song, <Br>
What is wrong with me? <br> </p>

</p> See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding, <Br>
But no one knows, how deep it goes <Br>
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me, <br>
And let me know, what's beyond, that line, will I cross that line? <br>

</p>

<p> The line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me <br>
And no one knows, how far it goes <Br>
if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, <Br>
One day I'll know, how far I'll go, <Br>

			 <br>   I just want to know if your smile, <br>
			    <br>  can make my heart, beat.  <br>
				 
			 <br>	 cause I'm a hoe,  <br>
				 <br>   for you, <br>
			 <br>	   if you can make me fall,  <br>
				 <br>   I'll make sure that everything would be worth it,  <br>
				   
				  <br>  and I know, that we won't last forever,  <br>
				  <br>     but at least we tried, and we both failed happily.  <br>

		 You're taking what you want right from me, <br>
		 Wrapped up in so much, <br>
		 Life is just the way you hold me, <br>
		 
		 You pick miscellaneously, <Br>
		 Wrapped in all the choices you're not giving me. <br>
		 
		 I'm laying on the floor, <br>
		 We're drinking cause we're bored. <br>
		 
		 Boy, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places, <br>
		 And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <br>
		 (One more time) <br>
		 Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places, <br>
		 And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces. <Br>
