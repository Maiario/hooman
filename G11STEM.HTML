  <p> What's More
  
  
  Situation: My best friend just broke up with this ex boyfriend for the seventh time this year, I adviced and persuaded her to never accept him again
  if he ever hit up her dm, she said that she agree's with me but then, when her boyfriend suddenly came back, she still accepted him.
  
  Result of the communication transaction: It turns out that she really loves him even though he only use her for his own benefits, 
  I stopped talking to her for a while after she ignored my advice for the seventh time. 
  
  Function of Communication: to Persuade and to Advice


 Situation: My best friend has a huge crush on my cousin, so she asked for my advice regarding this topic, I told her to confess her feeilngs to him tomorrow,
and she did, but it turns out that my cousin is already taken but he hides it in discreet. 

Result of the communication: She did my advice but she was still rejected, and rejection is not really a bad thing, I asked about what she have felt during that time,
and she told me that, after he rejected her, all of her feelings for him suddenly vanished, and that it didn't really hurt, and in fact she was somehow proud of her 
bravery to confess.

Function of Communication: Advice and Express 

Acitvity 2: Reflections

Today I learned that, Communication is highly useful in our day to day lives, it helps us avoid miscommunication, and have a better understanding about the subject
that is being transmitted to us, 

and I realized that, without communication, it will be hard for us humans to communicate properly with each other,

Therefore I will, resolve most of my misunderstanding to those people whom I can't communicate very well.
