	   <h2 class="cult"> Welcome to the Web of Void </h2>
	   <p> Our great Master created this website so she could store her knowlegde in programming! </p>
	   <p> I know one day, we the <strong> "codes" </strong> will be forgotten by our great master, so we urge her to create something
	   that would remind her about us. </p> 
	   <h1> We don't want to be forgotten!!! </h1>
  
         <p> to the person who is reading this! in order for you to inherit her knowledge, view the code file! it's hard to 
		 put some style in here since her knowledge is still basic atm <strong> *sniff* </strong> and we are hoping that you're
		 not a blockhead so you can learn this easily! </p>
		 
		<h2> Safe travel young lad! </h2>

<p class="wild"> <strong> History </strong> </p>

<p class="raon"> She learned programming from <strong> Khan Academy </strong>, the great guardian of the Khan Academy help her a lot when it comes to honing
her ability, we thank the great grand guardian for your help! <br>

The next one was <strong> Solo learn </strong>, it was confusing for her at first since she wasn't used to the new format of the app, but still, 
she persisted! <br>

Last but not the least, <strong> Github </strong> didn't teach her anything but, it showed her what will her future ideas will look like in the future!
<br> </p>

<P class="Hong"> She started getting interested in programming on April 2020, but she wasn't motivated enough that time
to learn about the greatness of programming, so she stopped, but then, something suddenly motivated her on August 2020 
to learn more about programming, and here it is now, the knowledge that she cultivated. </p>

<p class="On"> "Honestly, I'm still fucked at the moment, since my knowledge right now is still very  basic, although deep inside
I badly want to code something much better than this, like <strong> those cool website that you can see out there. </strong> but 
right now its still not possible since I'm still a beginner" <em> - the great master, mei. </em> </p>

<p class="Alberu"> I created this website on <strong> SEPTEMBER 9 2020 </strong> it still haven't been that long since I 
started my journey in learning prog. I still have a long way to go! wish me luck! </p>
