<h1 class="first"> MONTH OF OCTOBER </h1>

<h4> DATE: OCTOBER 1 2020 <br>
      Time: 11:57PM  <br>
	   Entry by: Mei <br>  </h4>
	   
	   <h5> Title: Beginning </h5>
	   
	   <P> Damn, its finally october, 9 days left and it will finally be my 16th birthday, and 3 days from now, the school opening will finally start. 
	       I'm low key nervous about our exam in ALS, I really really really want to pass, and after I pass, I promised that I'll do much better this time, 
		   like my current self will be 20 times much better than who I was in 2018-2019. </P>
		   
		   <p> I know that I've said this like 100 hundred times already, but I did regret dropping out but at the same time, I also didn't regret it, since
		   during my days of healing, I also learned a lot of shit, and I'm pretty much glad that I manage to outgrow some shits in my life. </p>
		   
		   <p> So i seriously wanna do better this time, like seriously, I know that my life will never be perfect, and I will still experience a lot of shit, but 
		    what's really important is <b> "outgrowing" </b> it, So I'm planning to upload a profile pic in my main account, and I'm scared, like I'm seriously scared,
			but I want to face my fears. </p>
			
		<p>	This fear of mine is pretty much just irrational, and I need to get rid of it. </p>
		
		<p> reason as to why its irrational </p>
		
		<ol>
		
		<li> - <b> I'm worried about likes, but some people out there doesn't really care if they don't get enough likes. </b> </li>
		<li> - <b> i'm worried about being judge, bish..so what? you're not doing something illegal so why do you have to worry? </b> </li>
		
		
		
		<ol>
		
		<p> If I actually passed our examination, then, that means that I'm officially a grade 11 student, and I need to get rid of my past trauma, fear, and a lot of my
unhealed parts, mentally, and psyhically. </p> 		


<p>  and after I did better and finally graduated in Grade 11, I'll start to buy some things that would be beneficial for me, and also, I'm planning to buy a guitar or a skateboard,
but I also want to buy a new phone, especially my own personal laptop, but I don't think that, that's currently possible, but I know that when I finally get into college, my life
would be pretty much different. </p>
