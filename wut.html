<h1> Entry; UHM? </h1>

<p> okay it did work, I wrote all of this shit instead of using the copy paste rn. </p>

<p> but anyways I'm reallyyyyyyyyy <b> bored </b> as fuck senddd helppppppp </P>

<p> I don't know when will the wifi be back to life again, and I badly want to play league since I didn't finish my missions yet <b> *sniff* </b> </p>

<p> I'm currently listening to einzelganger, Idk the spelling, but anyways, I'm trying to increase my brain cells somehow </p>

<p> I've been waiting for our examination date, the depEd didn't announced any shit that is related to als examination yet, but it has already been 7 months, at first
I wasn't really excited about our exam, since I don't want to face my responsibilities yet, and I'm afraid to fail, but after I read that module that my cousin
gave me, I kind of got excited about it, since I am high key hoping that our incoming exam is also modular and stuff, idk how to explain it but it's not literally modular, its
more like, our exam will only be answered <b> at home </b> , I feel like my english language communication and writing skills is disappearing again <strong> SCREAAAAAAAAMMM </strong>  </p>

<P> It's been like 3 days since my beloved wifi left me, and I don't know what should I feel right now, yes it's boring, really really boring, but I'm not that crazy enough
to act crazy about my beloved wifi leaving me, and I don't want to be atached to the internet that much. </p>

</p> I've been playing theotown too, The graphics hurts my soul a lot so I only played it for a short period of time, but anyways, <b> life is boring as fuck </b>

<p> and I'm also currently listening to billie eilish music playlist, and my ears is already bleeding since all of my music in here is on repeat </P> 

<P> but anyways (I know I've been saying anyways a lot but idgaf) , I'm really excited about me going to senior high soon, since the school year this year is really the best,
I feel like papa J granted my all time wish rn <b> BISH IM CRYINGGGGGG </b> like seriously, I don't have to go out nor participate in any school activity and its a <b> HUGE YEYYYYYYYYYY 
FORRRRRRRR MEEEEEEEE </b> </p> 

</div>

<p class="pickle"> I want to try monospace on this part, <br>

      I pick stem as my strand, since <em> obviously </em> its because of <b> "programming" </b> but I'm having second thoughts
	  about choosing programming as my career in the future, I don't know if "programming is highly wanted in the philippines, or can I get paid fairly if
	  I choose programming, or is it easy to find a job that is related to programming? and Am I capable enough to study "programming" ? I have a lot of doubts,
	 and at some point, I'm slowly considering to be a teacher since I feel like my college years wouldn't be a waste if I pick education, but I'm only picking education
	  since its the easist way to find a job and earn money but, I'm not passionate about it, I hate kids, like seriously, and teaching is not my forte.
	  
	  And I'm kind of .. afraid of the future, cause I know one day, I will lose my parents and the people that I love, and I will be alone at some point. 
	  but, I won't feel lonely as long as  <em> I'm happy with the person that I'm alone with, and that is myself. </em>

</p>

<p id="doubt"> I promised myself that I will do better this time, like if papa j give me the chance to redo everything (like if i pass the exam and jump to grade 11) I would
literally do my best this time. <br>

It's kind of ironic that I drop out because I was losing the motivation to study, but then, I dropped out for the second time since I was ashamed about being
behind, and then I enrolled in als so I could jump forward again. <br>

I did regret everything, but at the same time, I'm also not regretting it, since during my slamber, I also learned a lot of shit. <br>

I'm lowkey realizing that, if I won't work for my future now, then I will be nothing in the future too, and I will be like "this" people in my life atm, I'm not degrading them,
but maybe, I am actually degrading them? I just don't want to be like them, but why am I working on the path that will make me be like them? and I don't want to work on that path anymore.

My current obstacle right now, is being lazy, unmotivated, my anxiety, self confidence, and self doubt, and especially self love, I'm currently on the journey of finding myself. <br>

wish me luck. <br> </p>
